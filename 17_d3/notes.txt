- .enter() adds missing datum to the view
- .append() dictates in what element those datum are added, and returns the collection to which they were added
- .selectAll() gets all of the elements in the subelements in the elements of a specified type
- d3.mean(<array>), d3.max(<array>), d3.mean(<array>), d3.median(<array>)
- import {chart as chart1} with {values as data} from "@d3/histogram"
	- That line makes all the histogram magic happen
  - values is the array of values inserted into the histogram
